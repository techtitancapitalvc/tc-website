 *   web        a spider crossing a square grid, spinning threads to the nearest
 *   monogram   a letter cloud that turns once in 3D, then scrambles into a
 *              dot-matrix "TC" with a field band above and below
 *
 * THREE ENGINES, each for a reason:
 *
 *   CSS keyframes   the orbit and the star. They loop forever with no input,
 *                   so they should keep going whether or not React renders.
 *   rAF + refs      the spider. Its body moves every frame and its threads are
 *                   `x1`/`y1`/`x2`/`y2` — SVG attributes CSS cannot animate.
 *                   Writing them through refs avoids re-rendering the whole
 *                   grid sixty times a second — and every dot is re-lit each
 *                   frame as well, so that is 77 nodes plus 16 threads.
 *   Canvas          the monogram, because a couple of thousand particles is
 *                   far past what the DOM will animate. See its own note.
 *
 * NOTHING STARTS UNTIL IT IS SEEN. Every visual is wrapped by PartVisual in an
 * observed element: the CSS ones are paused through `animation-play-state`,
 * and the two rAF loops check the same flag themselves.
 *
 * DETERMINISM. Anything rendered on the server — the SVG dot field, the
 * triangle's vertices — is hand-picked, never Math.random, because a random
 * value chosen during render differs between server and client and React would
 * report a hydration mismatch. The canvas is exempt: it builds its particles
 * inside an effect, which only ever runs on the client.

/**
 * Reproduced from the reference clip (720x720, 60fps, 24.2s), measured frame
 * by frame with a radial profile: at each radius, how many of 180 sampled
 * angles are lit. A radius where most are lit is a ring; a radius where a few
 * discrete arcs are lit is the satellites, and the arc count is how many.
 *
 * THE CLIP IS TWO LOOPS, NOT ONE. That is the thing an earlier build missed —
 * it reproduced the first and stopped there.
 *
 *   LOOP ONE  t=0.4-7.4   The ring stays SMALL, fixed at r=13 the whole way.
 *                         One dot becomes six, they bloom to r=84, six merge
 *                         down to three, and the three fall back in.
 *   LOOP TWO  t=10.2-19.6 Starts as a PAIR, not six — two dots spreading left
 *                         and right to r=78. Then the RING ITSELF GROWS, 13 up
 *                         to 48 between t=12.6 and t=15.6, and only once it is
 *                         out do the satellites multiply, 2-3-4-5-6 over eight
 *                         tenths of a second, redistributing evenly each time.
 *                         Then they collapse and the big ring shrinks back to
 *                         13, which is where loop one starts again.
 *
 * Why this is rAF and not CSS keyframes like it used to be: the satellite
 * COUNT changes, and the survivors redistribute around the circle when it
 * does. Six fixed elements with their own keyframes cannot express "five dots
 * evenly spaced" — the positions depend on how many there currently are. In

   ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ */
/**
 * Rebuilt from the reference GIF rather than by eye: the file was pulled down
 * and all 53 frames measured, so every number below comes from the source.
 *
 * THE RINGS SWAP — they do not bounce. This is the thing that is easy to get
 * wrong, because the radii alone cannot tell you which it is: both models
 * produce the identical sequence of radius values. The angular offsets settle
 * it. Each ring carries a fixed offset (they sit 40/3 deg apart, one third of
 * the 40 deg node pitch), and those offsets TRADE PLACES across a merge:
 *
 *     frame 44   measured        [24.27, 37.48, 11.14]
 *                if they bounced [37.49, 11.12, 24.35]
 *
 * — a cyclic rotation of the baseline, not a return to it. So every ring
 * travels outward, and the outermost comes back round as the new innermost.
 *
 * That makes the whole thing ONE closed radius path with three rings spaced a
 * third of a period apart, rather than three rings each with their own range.
 * Fitted against the measured frames, within 3.5% of the half-size:
 *
 *     r(p) = 0.5 + 0.25 * cos(2pi * (p - 0.56))     (as a fraction of half)
 *
 * The merges fall out of it for free: rings a third of a period apart cross
 * at exactly the 50/125/125 and 75/75/150 the GIF measures.
 *
 * ROTATION IS NOT SEPARATE. Each ring also advances 40 deg — exactly one node
 * pitch — per period, so after one period every ring has moved up a role AND
 * turned by one node, and the figure is pixel-identical. That is why the

   4. "TC" MONOGRAM — a letter cloud that turns, then settles
   ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ */
/**
 * WHY THIS ONE IS A CANVAS AND THE OTHER THREE ARE NOT.
 *
 * The brief is thousands of letters flying in and settling into the wordmark.
 * At that count the DOM stops being an option: ~2,000 absolutely-positioned
 * elements, each with its own transform, is thousands of layout boxes and
 * composited layers to update every frame. One canvas is a single element and
 * one draw call per particle, and it does not touch layout at all.
 *
 * The letters are pre-rendered ONCE into small sprite canvases, one per
 * distinct character, and then blitted with drawImage. Calling fillText per
 * particle per frame would re-shape and re-rasterise the glyph 2,000 times a
 * frame, which is the difference between this running at 60fps and not.
 *
 * TARGETS COME FROM THE SHAPE ITSELF. "TC" is drawn to an offscreen canvas and
 * its pixels sampled on a grid; every opaque pixel becomes a home for one
 * particle. So the wordmark is never hard-coded as coordinates — change the
 * text or the font and the target cloud follows.
 */
/**
 * The letters the particles carry — as a SEQUENCE, not a bag to draw from.
 *
 * A cell's letter comes from its position on the grid, advancing by one for
 * every step right AND every step down, so the field reads T-I-T-A-N-C-A-P-I-
 * T-A-L across every row and down every column. See `letterAt` in `build`.

         many cells wide at any size that fits: a coarse grid catches almost

         enough to trace the shape turns back into a dense slab. Stroking the
         text does not help either — it outlines the letters, so "T" comes back
         as two parallel lines rather than a stem.
