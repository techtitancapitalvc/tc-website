 * /titanEcosystem page hero.
 *
 * Heading, a stack of overlapping founder avatars with a count beside them,
 * and a description. Black type on white.
 *
 * HEADING LEVEL 1 (HERO_HEADING_DARK_*), in black rather than the white this
 * level usually carries — the level is the type scale, the colour is the
 * section's own.
 *
 * IT IS ALWAYS TWO LINES, and that takes measuring rather than trusting.
 * Level 1 is 170px at 1728x1117, where "Cheque Comes With" wants 1856px of
 * one-line width against a 1440px column — so it wrapped, and the heading set
 * in three lines with the phrase "Titan Cheque" split across two of them.
 * `text-balance` cannot help: the line does not fit at any balance point.
 *
 * So the size is FITTED. Each line is measured at level 1 against the column
 * it has to live in, and the heading is scaled down by exactly the shortfall —
 * no further. Level 1 wherever level 1 fits, the largest size that holds two
 * lines everywhere else, whatever the editor types into Sanity.
 *
 * The description is LEVEL 5 (HERO_BODY_*), the standard description size.
