 * StoryCard. That one is still what the home page's "Their Stories" section
 * renders, and it works differently: a rotating tag pill top-left, everything
 * else hidden until hover. Changing it in place would have silently rewritten
 * the home page too.
 *
 * This one shows everything at rest, as designed:
 *   - the company logo in the TOP-LEFT corner
 *   - the quote across the bottom, centred
 *
 * The grid, the gaps and the scroll-drawn dividers around it are untouched.

/**
 * THE LOGO CROP.
 *
 * Every mark is a 400x400 canvas, and measuring all six shows they share one
 * convention exactly:
 *
 *     ink spans the FULL canvas width           x: 0 -> 400, all six
 *     ink is a vertically CENTRED band          worst offset 0.0012 of canvas
 *     band height varies                        0.133 (mamaearth) -> 0.305 (Shadowfax)
 *
 * So sizing by `height` sizes the CANVAS, not the mark — which is why the
 * logos came out at wildly different visual sizes, each floating at its own
 * height. Sizing by WIDTH is correct instead: the designer already normalised
 * these to a common width, and matching that respects it.
 *
 * The wrapper then crops away the dead band. Its height is the TALLEST mark's
 * band, and the image is pulled up so the canvas's centre line meets the
 * wrapper's — which lands every mark on the same top-left origin regardless of
 * how tall its own band is.
 *
 * THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT KEY OFF THE FILENAME. The live data is Sanity, so
 * `story.logo` is a CDN URL like `production/<hash>-400x400.png` — a lookup
 * table of local filenames silently matches nothing and every logo falls
 * through to the fallback. The crop above needs no per-logo constants, so it
 * works the same for a CDN URL as for a local file.
 *
 * The home page's StoryCard still uses `logoScale` / `logoOffsetY` against a
 * bottom-left anchor; those are untouched and stay its business.
