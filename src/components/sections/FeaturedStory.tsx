/**
 * FeaturedStories — server wrapper.
 *
 * THE BAND HAD NO DATA AT ALL. `/foundersstory` rendered `<FeaturedStories />`
 * with no props, so the component fell back to a hard-coded story whose `href`
 * was "#" — there was nothing to choose in the CMS and the "Read Full Story"
 * button went nowhere. This supplies both.
 *
 * WHICH STORY LEADS is the one ticked "Featured story" in the Founders Story —
 * Featured & Grid document. If none is ticked the first entry is used, so the
 * band is never empty; if several are, the first wins.
 *
 * The link is built by the SAME `storySlug` the grid cards use, so the band and
 * the card for one story can never point at different pages.
