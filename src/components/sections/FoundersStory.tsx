/**
 * FoundersStory — server wrapper for the grid on /foundersstory.
 *
 * ONE SOURCE. The cards come from `foundersStoryPage.stories[]` — the same
 * entries that own the article pages — so a card links to its own story by its
 * own slug and cannot point at a page that does not exist. This used to read
 * the home page's `impactAtGlance` singleton, and then a separate
 * `foundersStoryGrid` document; both are gone.
 *
 * The fallback is still the home page's FALLBACK_SLIDES: those are hard-coded
 * demo cards, not content, so sharing them costs nothing and keeps the grid
 * from rendering empty before the new document is filled in.
