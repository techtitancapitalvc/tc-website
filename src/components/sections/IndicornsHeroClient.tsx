/**
 * CHOREOGRAPHY
 *
 * `openness` (0 folded → 1 open) is NOT a function of scroll position. It is a
 * plain animated value, and the scroll wheel is treated as a discrete GESTURE
 * that triggers it. The sequence, on desktop:
 *
 *   land on the page      card folded
 *   scroll down once      that gesture is swallowed; the card unfolds and the
 *                         page is held for LOCK_SECONDS so you cannot scroll
 *                         straight past a card that is still opening
 *   scroll down again     nothing is intercepted — you simply carry on to the
 *                         next section. The card does NOT fold itself
 *   back at the top       if the card is shut (the arrow closed it), the next
 *                         downward scroll opens it again — the gesture re-arms
 *                         purely from "shut AND at the top", so it never gets
 *                         permanently used up
 *
 * WHY A GESTURE AND NOT SCROLL POSITION. A scrubbed version needs a tall
 * runway plus a sticky pin, and then coming back up the runway replays the
 * fold in reverse; suppressing that replay leaves a screenful of empty pinned
 * scrolling.
 *
 * WHY THE PAGE DOESN'T JUMP. The section stays in normal flow and really does
 * grow when it opens — but that is gated to scrollY 0, so the size change
 * happens strictly BELOW the top edge of the viewport. Nothing on screen
 * moves; the sections underneath are simply pushed further down. And because
 * the card never folds on its own, the section can no longer collapse out from
 * under a reader who is already partway down the page.
 *
 * LOCK_SECONDS is deliberately shorter than OPEN_SECONDS. Every scroll input
 * that arrives while the page is held is swallowed outright, so a lock lasting
 * the whole unfold makes the page feel like it is ignoring you. Releasing
 * early lets the last leaves settle while you are already moving on.
 *
 * The open card needs no help filling the screen: it measures 965px of a
 * 1117px viewport, and 615px of 617px on a short laptop.
 *
 * MOBILE opts out entirely: no gesture capture and no fixed height. The open
 * card is 797px against an 812px viewport on a tall phone and overflows a
 * short one outright, so a "you cannot scroll past" rule there would trap the
 * reader. On mobile the arrow button is the only control and the page scrolls
 * normally at all times.

                   stood 425px tall to hold one line of type.

                   This is also the lever on the gap BELOW the heading once the

                   fold panel's own top padding, so trimming here narrows the

                   The HORIZONTAL value is the smaller of the two on purpose.
                   Nothing but the heading row lives in this box — the three
                   fold panels carry their own, much wider, PANEL_PADDING — so

                    HEIGHT is the height of the BOX, and with WORDMARK_ASPECT
                    the box is now the artwork — so every term is the old one
                    scaled by 118/144, the fraction the artwork actually filled
                    before. The rendered logo is therefore unchanged at every
                    viewport; only the empty margin around it is gone.

                    WIDTH BUDGET — why the ceiling is 118px and not higher.
                    This box is `shrink-0` with a fixed aspect, so it cannot
                    give way: if heading + gap + wordmark exceeds the card's
                    inner width, the row wraps and the card grows by a whole
                    extra line. The worst case is the widest heading, which is
                    its 112px clamp ceiling — "WHAT ARE" measures 588px there.
                    Against the 1136px inner width (1200px cap − 2 × 32px):

                        588 heading + 14 gap + 500 wordmark = 1102px   ✓ 34px spare

                    Originally this was 150px / 3.5:1 — a 525px wordmark and a
                    1137px row against the 1072px available then, so every
                    viewport tall enough to reach the heading ceiling wrapped
                    and cost the card an extra 172px of height. */}
