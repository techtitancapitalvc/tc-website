 * Framing for a team member's portrait inside the blob cutout.
 *
 * Lives here rather than in OurTeamClient because that file is `"use client"`,
 * and the /ourteam/[slug] page is a server component — a server component can
 * render a client component but cannot call a function exported from one. This
 * module has no "use client" pragma and no React runtime, so both sides can
 * import it.
 *
 * Scale is anchored bottom-centre, keeping the subject planted on the blob's
 * base rather than drifting as it grows. The offsets sit first in the transform
 * list — which CSS applies right-to-left, so they run AFTER the scale, in
 * unscaled units. That keeps zoom and position independent: retune one and the
 * other stays put.
