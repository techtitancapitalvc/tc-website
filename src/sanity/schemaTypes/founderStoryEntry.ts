/**
 * One founder story — an OBJECT, not a document.
 *
 * Stories live inside the single "Founders Story Page" document (see
 * foundersStoryPage.ts), the same way team members live inside "Our Team
 * Page". /foundersstory/[slug] finds its story by looking up the slug in that
 * array, so adding a story is one entry in one place rather than a new
 * document to create and remember to publish.
 *
 * THE HEADER IS FIXED, THE REST IS A LIST. Tags, headline, founders and hero
 * image are the story's identity — every story opens the same way, so letting
 * them be dragged around would let one open on a quote and another on a photo.
 * Everything after them lives in `blocks`, an ordered list the editor composes
 * and reorders freely. See storyBlocks.ts for what can go in it.
