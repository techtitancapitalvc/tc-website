/**
 * One blog post — an OBJECT, not a document.
 *
 * Posts live inside the single "Blogs Page" document (see blogsPage.ts), the
 * same way team members live inside "Our Team Page". Editors add, reorder and
 * delete posts from one place rather than hunting through a flat list of
 * documents, and the listing order is simply the array order.
 *
 * The one object feeds BOTH surfaces:
 *
 *   /blogs          the card — cover, tags, meta line, title, excerpt
 *   /blogs/[slug]   the article — that same header, then the acts
 *
 * so a card can never drift from the post it links to.
 *
 * THE HEADER IS FIXED, THE REST IS A LIST. Title, one-liner and cover image
 * open every article; everything after them lives in `blocks`, the same
 * ordered list the founder stories use, composed and reordered freely. See
 * storyBlocks.ts for what can go in it.
